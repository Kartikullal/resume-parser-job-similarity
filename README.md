# resume-parser-job-similarity


Developed a machine learning tool that parses resumes from PDF to JSON and uses an NER model to recognize skills. We utilized Python libraries like Spacy, Genism, and Huggingface to fine-tune the model and achieved an 85% accuracy rate. We also used cosine similarity to compare resumes and job descriptions, resulting in a 92% similarity score. The project demonstrated the power of machine learning in streamlining the recruitment process.
